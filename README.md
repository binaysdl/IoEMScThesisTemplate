# IoEMScThesisTemplate

IoEMScThesisTemplate is developed with modification to the MasterDoctoralThesis template available at [Latextemplates.com](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/masters-doctoral-thesis). It is adopted to adhere to the unorthodox requirement of MSc Thesis formatting in Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.

You may find the guides to use the MasterDoctoralThesis template suitable for this one. The following websites may help you.

- [Unofficial MDT Guide](https://github.com/johannesbottcher/MDT-Quick-Manual)
- [IoE Phd Thesis Template](https://ioe.edu.np/programs/post-graduate-ph-d/)
- [Nilshoell's latex template](https://github.com/nilshoell/latex-template)

## Things to note
The format demands numbering chapters as **Chapter ONE** and then section as **1.1**. This has been addressed in this template, however I recommend to use \hyperref[label of chapter]{intended text to display} while referring to these chapters to avoid **ONE** in middle of the text.
